# Advanced Facial Recognition System

This Python script utilizes OpenCV and the face_recognition library to implement an advanced facial recognition system. The system is designed to capture real-time video frames, identify faces, and display the recognized person's name. It includes a known face for comparison and uses advanced algorithms for face recognition.

## Features

- Real-time facial recognition using OpenCV and face_recognition.
- Advanced algorithms for accurate face identification.
- Customizable system with the ability to add or update known faces.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2` module)
- face_recognition library

## Installation

1. Install Python: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install OpenCV:
   ```bash

  pip install opencv-python

Install face_recognition library:pip install face_recognition
<br>
Run the script:RealtimefaceReco
